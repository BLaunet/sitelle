The Sitelle package is a helper module designed for the analysis of M31 datacubes taken by SITELLE instrument. It is mainly a prototype. The developpement is as generic as possible but sometimes **very specifically oriented towards the M31 galaxy and the SN2 and SN3 filters** used for its observation.

It strongly relies on the [ORB](https://github.com/thomasorb/orb) and [ORCS](https://github.com/thomasorb/orcs) packages, and most of its content is devoted to be merged with these projects at some point. Sitelle includes features extensions and bug corrections with respect to ORCS, as well as new functions and methods used during the specific reduction of M31 datacubes.
