*****************************************
Welcome to sitelle package documentation!
*****************************************

This package holds a few convenient methods to be used with `ORCS <http://132.203.11.199/orcs-doc/index.html>`_
and `ORBS <http://132.203.11.199/orcs-doc/index.html>`_ packages.
The main feature is its nburst module, that enables the fit of SITELLE spectra
with Nburts directly.
The installation of Nburst has to be done separately.
